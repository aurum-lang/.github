  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Aurum Programming Language
</h1>

Aurum is a functional high level interpreted scripting language.  
Designed for pure functional use with inspiration from other mainstream languages, and including concurrency as a first class citizen, 
Aurum provides a powerful interface to perform more abstract and theoretical programming rather than focus on wide feature ranges like io or fs.
